VAST Challenge 2016- GasTech Operations Analysis

Project Overview

Our project, conducted by Team Eywa, addresses security concerns at GAStech Corporation's new facility on Kronos Island. We have utilized a variety of sensor data to identify patterns and potential risks, enhancing security measures through data-driven insights.

Abstract

This project explores the security implications at GAStech Corporation's Kronos Island facility by analyzing data from building sensors, including proximity cards, Hazium readings, and HVAC sensor data. Our analysis focuses on identifying anomalous behavior and correlations that could indicate security threats or breaches. Insights from this data help to bolster the security framework at the facility.

Data Sources

The data set includes:

Building floor plans and zone maps.
CSV files for proximity sensors and card data.
Hazium concentration readings across four zones.
HVAC system sensor data.
Tools and Technologies Used

Python for data manipulation and analysis.
Visual Analytics Tools for generating insights from the data.
Key Findings

Power Consumption: Identified anomalies in power usage that correlated with other unusual data points.
HVAC and Hazium Levels: Found significant correlations between unusual HVAC readings and spikes in Hazium levels.
Employee Movement Patterns: Analyzed data from proximity cards to track employee movements and identified abnormal patterns, including unexpected presence during off-hours and on weekends.
Visualizations

Hazium vs. CO2 Readings: Graph showing synchronicity in spikes of Hazium and CO2, which could indicate unusual activities.
Employee Proximity Card Entries: Visualization of employee card swipes over time, highlighting typical work hours and anomalies.
Weekend Activity Analysis: Specific instances of employee presence linked to high Hazium levels.
Conclusion

Our project leverages advanced visual analytics to provide insights into the operational security of GAStech Corporation's new facility. By understanding employee behaviors and environmental sensor data, we can identify and address potential security risks effectively.
